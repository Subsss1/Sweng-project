Software Engineering Project 2024
Group 11
Client: Pico

Project Description:
The project aims to develop a Wireshark dissector capable of classifying network traffic as either human-generated or machine-generated. 
This involves collecting a dataset of network traffic examples, extracting relevant features and training machine learning models. 
The dissector will then utilise these models to classify captured packets or flows in real-time, displaying the results within Wireshark's interface. 
The end goal is to enhance network analysis by distinguishing between human and automated traffic patterns.
